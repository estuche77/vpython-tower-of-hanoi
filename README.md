# Tower of Hanoid in Python 2.7 + VPython

3D Tower of Hanoi example made with Python and VPython.

**Note:** This commit was done for historical purposes only since this is the original code done by me in 2015. It contains the original installers in the event that I can no longer find them in the future.

## Prerequisites

As for today, you can get `Python 2.7.9` and `VPython 6.11` here: [https://vpython.org/contents/download_windows.html](https://vpython.org/contents/download_windows.html)

There is an `installers` directory as well on this commit containing the required resources to run the original version of this project.

## Getting started

This is a console project that can be executed the following way:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/estuche77/vpython-tower-of-hanoi.git
cd vpython-tower-of-hanoi/
python Modulo3D.py
```

## Built With

- `Python 2.7.9`
- `VPython 6.11`

## History

I created this project on the first half of 2015 for the **Introduction to Programing** course given by the professor **Carlos Benavides** at the [Costa Rica Institute of Technology](https://www.tec.ac.cr/). The goal of this project was to get started with recursive programming by implementing the solution of the Tower of Hanoi game.
